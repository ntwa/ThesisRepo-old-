\section{Study Description}
The purpose of this study was to elicit preliminary requirements to inform the design of an early prototype of a personal informatics that can be utilized through intermediaries. Preliminary requirements were generated on collected insights on various issues related technology utilization, and  barriers to behaviours that are considered healthy. These insight were generated as from data collected in hospital settings with patients who might be prospective beneficiaries of such a technology in future. The objective was to understand patterns in utilization of cellphone technology among adults obese patients. This study was approved by the respective institution's ethical review body \footnote{Human Research Ethics Committee of Faculty of Health Sciences at University of Cape Town}.

I together with one research assistant conducted this contextual inquiry in between March 2013 and May 2015. We recruited a convenience sample of diabetic patients at a diabetes and endocrinology clinic of Groote Schuur
Hospital in Cape Town.This is an outpatient clinic which runs on Thursdays and Fridays.

Participants were approached opportunistically as they waited to see their physicians. We conducted interviews in one of the vacant consultation rooms. This guaranteed confidentiality and privacy of participants. The main topics in these semi-structured interviews were focused around participants' general utilization of mobile phones, whether they seek help from intermediaries, and, if so, who their preferred intermediaries are. In addition we explored their current barriers to both exercise  and adoption of healthy diets.

We obtained our data from a total of 30 participants. Twenty of the participants were females. Majority of the participants had low level  of (education) as shown on Figure \ref{figure:education_level} while their distribution by ethnicity is shown on Table \ref{table:ethnicity} of which all of them were from previously disadvantaged races during apartheid era in South Africa. Majority of these participants were also low income earners (Figure \ref{figure:income_distr}), this income data was for individuals and not households. Twenty three percent didn't have any income and they depend on their family members to sustain themselves. In this group of people with no income, there was only one young person who was 21 years of age while the remaining participants were above 40 years of age.

Most of them participants were either overweight or obese with an average body mass index (BMI) of 33.36 kg/m\SP{2} (standard deviation of 5.74 kg/m\SP{2}). The average age was 53.13 years old (standard deviation of 11.77 years old).  Almost 86\% (26) were above 40 years of age. This means we were dealing with old participants and hence this group had a tendency of being inexperience with technology.

\section{Data Collection Methods and Analysis}
We used a semi structured questionnaire to interview participants. Each participant was interviewed for a period of 20 to 30 minutes. The questionnaire had four groups of questions and these included demographics: cellphone ownership and utilization; access to ormation and pedometers; and barriers to diet and physical activity. 

I used both descriptive statistics and qualitative approaches to analyse the information obtained from participants’ responses. Although our objective was to interview overweight and obese patients only but we included few participants who appeared to be thin but were diabetic. Since diabetes is a lifestyle related disease, we found that it would be interesting to also understand utilization of cellphones, and access to information even to individuals who appear not to be overweight but these individuals may had some input on various issues related technology utilization, and  barriers to behaviours that are considered healthy.

\section{Findings}
\subsection{Utilization of Cellphones}
Twenty nine out of thirty participants owned cellphones. The most used services were SMS and voice with at least 80\% of the participants using each of the two services. It was found that at least 60\% of the phones owned by participants were smart-phones (Figure \ref{figure:cell_ownership}), but utilization of functionality/services that are supported in smart-phones appeared to be lower relative to voice and SMS (Figure \ref{figure:cell_utilization}). Utilization of smart-phone supported services appeared to decrease with age. Utilization of Whatsapp appeared to be higher compared to other services that are specific to smart-phones. What led to adoption of Whatsapp is that participants were influenced by family members and friends who were already in Whatsapp. These influencers suggested Whatsapp as to be cheaper than SMS. For instance one male participant aged 47 years of age heard that Whatsapp was cheap for communication, and his son helped him on loading it into his phone. Therefore, in this context, social influence played a role in adoption of some smart-phone supported services. There is a positive correlation between social influence and adoption of high-tech innovations \citep{vannoy2010social}.

\subsection{Help Seeking in Utilization of Cellphones}
There were several scenarios of informal help seeking in utilization of cellphones as highlighted on Table \ref{table:intermediated}. Majority of the participants had solicited  informal help from other people before, in tasks such as: (1) to configure services/apps on their phones (e.g. Whatsapp, Facebook); (2) habituation of skills required for utilization of various functionality (e.g. a phone book of a new or unfamiliar cellphone, Whatsapp); and (3) to interact with certain features such as SMS, Internet browsers, and etc. There was a variation in the degree of help-seeking and it was determined by how often participants wanted execute unfamiliar tasks. Tasks such as configuration of services and apps or teaching of individuals had rare occurrences  occur as they only happened when participants had encountered a new application or device and they don't know how to make it functional. 

\subsection{Selection of Help Givers}
Help givers are selected based on the merit of competence and trust.  Participants chose trusted individuals to act as their help givers, typically their children and grandchildren or, less often, children of relatives, family friends, or someone at a cellphone shop. Preference on who is likely to be solicited to assist is given to family members.

	\hline
	11&Her \emph{son} and \emph{grandson} have once helped to configure Whatsapp and Facebook on her phone. They have also taught her on how to use those two web services. In addition, she also asks the son to search for certain health information on the Internet, and once the search is done the the son would pass the phone to her to view that information. This happens once in a month.\\
	\hline
	12& Her \emph{son} and \emph{grandson} always teach her on how to use various functionalities like games etc., but she is not so much keen on operating those functionalities. She also admitted that her son and grandson are so much interested with their mobile phones and they spend a lot of time playing using phones something that she doesn't understand.\\
	\hline
	13& She had no formal education and she didn't know how to operate a cellphone at all. The son receives SMS on her behalf and he only gives her verbal communication. Also, the son receives phone calls and hands over the phone to her when the person on the other side of the line wants to speak to her.\\

Most of apartheid policies towards health didn't focus towards these populations and some of the current health and economical concerns are as result of amplifications of apartheid social clusters \citep{benatar2013challenges}.
