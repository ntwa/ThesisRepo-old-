\section{Recruitment of Participants}
With help of a research assistant who was a resident of Langa,  we managed to recruit a total of fourteen adult participants (beneficiary users). We recruited these participants from two townships in Cape Town: Langa, and Athlone. In Langa there were five adult participants while in Athlone there were nine adult participants. The average age of these adult participants was 44.21 years with a standard deviation (S.D) of 9.99 years. The youngest adult was 26 years of age while the oldest was 60 years of age. Thirteen participants were females.

Each adult participant (beneficiary user) elected one of their children/grand children to become their intermediary user to form a pair of users. The two members of a pair were required to work together in using the ``Family Wellness App'' to self-monitor the wellness of one member of a pair (a beneficiary user). All beneficiary users were working with their children but one whom was was working with her grand child.  The average age of children participants (intermediary users) was 15.42 (S.D=2.06) years. The youngest intermediary user was 12 years of age while the oldest was 20 years of age. The number of females and males intermediary users were equal.

I gave out detailed information of what the study was all about to both intermediary and beneficiary participants. I informed them about different modes of which I will collect data. All beneficiary participants signed informed consent forms agreeing to be part of the study. Since all intermediaries were under 21 years of age, they signed assent forms which were also signed by their respective parents/guardians who were part of the study.

One day was allocated for training intermediary participants on how to use the ``Family Wellness App''. In addition, each intermediary was given a user manual. After the training, I gave out one Android phone (Samsung GT-S5300) to each pair of participants. These phones were installed with two natives apps. The first app was a pedometer and the second one was the main ``Family Wellness App''. The ``Family Wellness App'' loaded all its content from a web application hosted remotely. Each beneficiary participants was required to carry the phone with them all the time in order for the pedometer app to count their steps. The two apps (main app and pedometer) were made available to the participants for a total period of six weeks. Each pair of participants provided the service provider's number of the SIM card that was inserted on their given Android phone. I allocated 1.3 GB of data to each SIM card. In addition each beneficiary participant was given a total of ZAR 240 as a compensation for transport and their time for the duration of the study. The details of the experiments are outlined on the next section.
\section{Experiments}
This phase of the study evaluated the effectiveness of gamification/rewards in motivating both intermediaries and beneficiaries to engage with the ``Family Wellness App''. I was comparing two versions of the applications. The first version of the application was simply a logbook or journal that allows each pair of users to record and view wellness data of a beneficiary member of a pair. With the logbook app, users could, view physical activity graphs, and recording and viewing summaries of nutrition components of food consumed by a beneficiary within a pair. The second version of the application was an extension of logbook  with an addition of a rewards/gamified subsystem. The experiments took place from the mid-October 2015 to the end of November 2015.  The details of how experiments were designed and how data were collected are presented on the next sub-section.
\subsection{Experiment Design}
The study used ``within-group'' design for the experiments. In within-group design, the same group of participants were exposed to different experimental conditions. This helps to minimize the number of groups needed to test hypotheses as only one group is used for both control and intervention. Another advantage of within-group design is that it minimizes the effect of confounding factors. The only problem with this approach is the learning effect and in addition, it lengthens duration of a study. In order to minimize the impact of the learning effect on the outcome, I randomly assigned pairs of participants to two separate groups referred to as experimental sequences. The first experimental sequence started with the ``Logbook App''  and finished with the ``Gamified App''. The second experimental sequence started with the ``Gamified App'' and finished with the ``Logbook App''. I used the following abbreviations ``LG'' and ``GL'' to refer to the first and second experimental sequences respectively.

A total of seven pairs of participants were assigned to the LG group while the remaining seven pairs were assigned to the GL group. Both groups spent the first four weeks in their first experimental conditions of which the ``Logbook App'' for the LG group and the ``Gamified App'' for the GL group. After 27 days (four weeks) each group was switched to a different experimental condition. The LG group started using the Gamified App while the GL group started using the Logbook App. The second phase of the experiment lasted for a total of 14 days (two weeks). 

The explanation of why four weeks in phase 1 and two weeks in phase 2 is as follows. Initially the plan was to have time spent on each experimental condition, be three(3) weeks intervals, but phase one had extended beyond three weeks up to fourth week as participants were not available for midline assessments at the end of the third week. Therefore, The research team carried out the assessment at the end of the fourth week and then followed by swapping of participants from one experimental condition to the other. This shortened the period for phase two from three to two weeks. Also, It was not feasible to extend phase two since it was approaching December of whereby most people travel for holidays, therefore, gathering participants during that time may have been impractical.
\subsection{Data Collection Methods and Analysis}
Data collection was a triangulation of application's logs,questionnaires and interviews. 
\subsubsection{Family Wellness App Logs}
Application's logs consisted of information regarding the time when there were users' activities on the app, the pair that was accessing the app at that time, and the functionality that was being accessed by that pair. Logs were categorized to their respective experimental conditions.  
Usage was measured by counting the number of sessions and clicks. A new session was defined as a period of detection of user's activity in an absence of any activity from this user/pair in the past one hour or more.
 
I carried out usage comparison in two dimensions. The first comparison entailed comparing the daily total number of sessions between the two experimental conditions for 41 days of experiments.

In the second comparison, it was pairwise comparison of users' sessions in between logbook and gamification conditions. In order to ensure this comparison of usage is not affected by different experimental durations, I opted to use a relative number of unit measurement. In this case I used the number of sessions per day since the number of days on which pairs of users spent on a particular experimental condition differ between LG and GL group. For instance the LG group spent nearly four weeks in logbook and two weeks in gamification while the GL group spent four weeks in gamification and two weeks in logbook. In this second usage comparison, there were four pairs that were excluded from this usage analysis. These are pairs that faced hurdles on utilizing the app and this affected their ability to fully experience and engage with what was being offered by the gamified system. These pairs are listed on Table \ref{table:usageproblems}.
\begin{table}[h!]
  \begin{center}
    \caption{Pairs with usability/technical problems that hinder their participation}
    \label{table:usageproblems}
	\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|p{6cm}|}

	\hline
	\end{tabular}
  \end{center}
\end{table}
For \textbf{Pair A}, the app failed to load every time their intermediary user tried to use it. What was observed from the house where this pair lived in is that there was a poor Internet signal, hence the app was always failing to load most of the time. The second pair (\textbf{Pair B}), data was allocated to the wrong phone number at the beginning of experiments but they never reported on time. These two pairs (Pair A and Pair B) had the lowest usage days which were 2 and 3 days respectively and they they had used the app only in gamification condition.

For the last two pairs (\textbf{Pairs C} and \textbf{D}) on Table \ref{table:usageproblems}, their pedometers were not transmitting steps' data to the server. Steps data were important for advancement of badges, and improvement of both the fish tank and botanical garden in gamification condition. Pair C's pedometer never transmitted any readings to the server even in logbook condition.  Pair D's pedometer stopped transmitting steps data on the fourth week of running the experiments and this was before this particular user was switched to gamification condition. The two intermediary users from Pair C and Pair D were close friends. Although the pedometer never transmitted data in Pair C  since the beginning of experiments, an intermediary user from this pair continued to use the wellness app because of the informal comparison with an intermediary user from Pair D while they were both still in logbook condition. The usage in Pair C and Pair D were both eleven days. Their drop out started during gamification condition. Pair C used the app for only three days and Pair D used it for only one day. Since gamification depended on transmission of steps to the server, pedometer problems affected Pair C and Pair D motivations to participate in gamification phase despite their efforts during logbook condition. The learning effect coupled with problems with their pedometers mediated their decrease in usage with the app.  An intermediary user from another pair in "LG" group who happened to live close to the Pair D and Pair C, shared her concerns about the rewards from the gamified app. This was during the endline interviews. This particular intermediary user didn't appreciate her advancement in badges because she admitted that her peers (the two intermediary users from Pair C and Pair D) did more efforts than her but they were not getting anything so she didn't understand why she was ahead of them. She was referring to their usage during logbook condition as they were both using the ``logbook App'' at the same time.  This proves that usability problems played a role to the some extent in demotivating participation in gamification condition  of intermediary users from Pair C and Pair D.
\subsubsection{Questionnaires}\label{methodsquestionnaire}
The reaserch team administered questionnaires at baseline, mid-line (during switching of experimental conditions), and end-line. The list of questionnaires is provided below.
\begin{enumerate}
\item{\textbf{Baseline Questionnaires}}

At baseline both intermediary and beneficiary participants filled their respective questionnaires. 
\begin{itemize}
\item{\textbf{Intermediaries}}: Intermediaries participants' baseline questionnaire had three sections. The first section captured demographic information such as age,gender, and number services/apps used on cellphones. The second section included an IMI (Intrinsic Motivation Inventory) questionnaire  to assess participants' intrinsic motivation in using cellphones. The third section included an IMI questionnaire to assess participants' intrinsic motivation in helping their parents with cellphone based tasks.
\item{\textbf{Beneficiaries}}: Beneficiary participants' baseline questionnaire had four sections. The first section captured demographic information such as age,gender, and number services/apps used on cellphones. The second section included an IMI questionnaire to assess participants' intrinsic motivation in using cellphones. The third section included an IMI questionnaire to assess participants' intrinsic motivation in self-monitoring of diet/nutrition. The fourth section included an IMI questionnaire to assess participants' intrinsic motivation in self-monitoring of physical activity.
\end{itemize}
\item{\textbf{Midline Questionnaires}}

Also at midline both intermediary and beneficiary participants filled their respective questionnaires. 
\begin{itemize}
\item{\textbf{Intermediaries}}: Intermediaries participants' midline questionnaire had only one section which included an IMI questionnaire  to assess participants' intrinsic motivation in using the family wellness app.
\item{\textbf{Beneficiaries}}: Beneficiary participants' baseline questionnaire had four sections. The first section included an IMI questionnaire  to assess participants' intrinsic motivation in using the family wellness app. The third section included an IMI questionnaire to assess participants' intrinsic motivation in self-monitoring of diet/nutrition. The fourth section included an IMI questionnaire to assess participants' intrinsic motivation in self-monitoring of physical activity.
\end{itemize}
\item{\textbf{Endline Questionnaires}}

At endline both intermediary and beneficiary participants filled their respective questionnaires. 
\begin{itemize}
\item{\textbf{Intermediaries}}: Intermediaries participants' endline questionnaire had only one section which included an IMI questionnaire  to assess participants' intrinsic motivation in using the family wellness app.
\item{\textbf{Beneficiaries}}: Beneficiary participants' endline questionnaire had three sections. The first section included an IMI questionnaire  to assess participants' intrinsic motivation in using the family wellness app. The third section included an IMI questionnaire to assess participants' intrinsic motivation in self-monitoring of diet/nutrition.The fourth section included an IMI questionnaire to assess participants' intrinsic motivation in self-monitoring of physical activity.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
I developed the IMI questionnaires with the guidance of materials found on a ``Self-Determination Theory''\footnote{http://www.selfdeterminationtheory.org/intrinsic-motivation-inventory/} website which is maintained by researchers working on the theory including Richard Ryan and Edward Deci\citep{deci1985intrinsic} whom were early pioneers in developing the theory. I pretested these questionnaires during the informative evaluation of prototype II in chapter \ref{prototytpe2chapter}.  The most most important sub-scales for our theoretical construct were perceived competence and perceived autonomy which are part of the three basic psychological needs. The relatedness sub-scale is not yet validated but it was included in all questionnaires. Other sub-scale that was included in all questionnaires is perceived enjoyment. Perceived enjoyment is the only direct measure of intrinsic motivation while perceived competence and perceived autonomy are predictors of intrinsic motivation. Self-Determination theory suggests that a behaviour can be started as externally motivated and if external motivators support the three basic psychological needs which are relatedness, competitiveness, and autonomy then a behaviour that was once externally motivated can be internalized and users will start doing it because it is a good thing to do.

In addition to the aforementioned sub-scales, perceived usefulness and perceived efforts also appear in specific questionnaires (i.e self-monitoring of diet and activity, use of cellphone). These specific questionnaires don't assess specific constructs of self-determination theory as they focus on the overall intrinsic motivation. The overall IMI scores were computed by averaging the scores from each sub-scales.

In each question from the IMI sub scales, respondents were supposed to rate there experience in a scale of 1 to 7 points which means that 1 implies the statement is "not true at all" and 7 means the statement is "very true".

There were three main objectives of using the IMI questionnaire. The first objective was to assess the ability of the two prototypes in supporting the participants with the three basic psychological needs. The difference in experimental durations was expected not to have any effect on motivations to use either of the two systems since both logbook and gamification were both present in both phases of experiments. Therefore, effects on motivations due to different durations were expected to cancel each other during analysis. I compared between the ability of the two prototypes in affording three basic psychological needs suggested by self-determination theory. In addition, I also included perceptions on enjoyment as it is a direct measure of intrinsic motivation. The corresponding scales from the IMI questionnaire were administered at midline and endline . Therefore, there were four sub-scales; perceived competence, perceived autonomy, perceived enjoyment and perceived relatedness.  For the reason I stated above, I decided to exclude users from  Pair A and C on Table \ref{table:usageproblems} , and Pairs E and F on Table \ref{table:negexprnce}. A total of ten pairs were considered for analysis on the aforementioned intrinsic motivation sub-scales. The hypotheses of interest for intermediaries were:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Hypothesis 1}
\begin{itemize}
\item{H\SB{0}}:There is no difference in perceived competence in using the app between a logbook app and gamified app
\item{H\SB{A}}:There is a difference in perceived competence in using the app between a logbook app and gamified app
\end{itemize}
\item{Hypothesis 1}
\begin{itemize}
\item{H\SB{0}}:There is no difference in perceived autonomy in using the app between a logbook app and gamified app
\item{H\SB{A}}:There is a difference in perceived autonomy in using the app between a logbook app and gamified app
\end{itemize}
\item{Hypothesis 3}
\begin{itemize}
\item{H\SB{0}}:There is no difference in perceived enjoyment in using the app between a logbook app and gamified app
\item{H\SB{A}}:There is a difference in perceived enjoyment in using the app between a logbook app and gamified app
\end{itemize}
\item{Hypothesis 4}
\begin{itemize}
\item{H\SB{0}}:There is no difference in perceived relatedness in using the app between a logbook app and gamified app
\item{H\SB{A}}:There is a difference in perceived relatedness in using the app between a logbook app and gamified app
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

The second objective of having IMI questionnaires was to use the overall IMI scores in assessing motivations of beneficiaries in self-monitoring of diet and activity, and motivations to use cellphone of both intermediaries and beneficiaries. These IMI questionnaires included perceptions of beneficiaries on competence, autonomy, relatedness, enjoyment, effort, and usefulness. I also examined motivation of intermediaries to help at baseline through a perceived enjoyment sub-scale of IMI questionnaire.

In motivations to self-monitor diet and activity, I excluded pairs (A,B, C, and D) from Table \ref{table:usageproblems} with problems that led to discontinuation of usage. In total only ten out of fourteen beneficiaries had their results included for analysis. In the comparison for self-monitoring of diet and activity, the first IMI comparison  entailed comparing the IMI score of each participant at baseline, midline, and endline regardless of an experimental condition. In the second comparison I compared scores at baseline, logbook, and gamification condition. The IMI score was computed from the average of all scores from sub-scales of perceived competence, perceived autonomy, perceived relatedness, perceived enjoyment, perceived effort,  and perceived usefulness. I  used one way ANOVA with repeated measures to test if there was a difference  between scores at: (1) baseline, midline, and endline, and (2)baseline, logbook and gamification. I used Mauchy's test\footnote{Read more on how Mauchy's test is used from http://www.statisticshell.com/docs/repeatedmeasures.pdf} to checked if different measuring points had the same covariance in each ANOVA test I carried out and this helped in deciding of whether to ``Sphericity Assumed'',``Greenhouse-Geisser'', or ``Huynh-Feldt'' of SPSS output.
\subsubsection{Interviews}
I also conducted short unstructured interviews at midline and endline. I selected fewer intermediaries and beneficiaries for the interviews. Interviews responses were important in supplementing data collected through questionnaires and application's logs.
\section{Findings}
There were four primary outcomes in analysing the findings and these are: (1)usage trend of the app; (2) user experience/intrinsic motivation  of both intermediaries and intermediaries in using the app; (3) intrinsic motivation of beneficiaries in self-monitoring of diet/nutrition; and (4) intrinsic motivation of beneficiaries in self-monitoring of physical activity.
\subsection{Usage Outcome}
\label{usageoutcome}
The average number of days on which pairs used both versions of the application was 10.5 (SD=7.39) days. The most active usage was from a pair that utilized the app for a total of 26 days. The less active usage was from a pair that had used the app for only two days out of 41 days.

\end{figure}
Findings on comparison of daily total number sessions summed from all users in each experimental condition showed that gamification had a significant total number of daily sessions compared to logbook as demonstrated by a non-parametric test called Mann-Whitney U Test on Table \ref{table:usagedays}. I made a decision to use the aforementioned test because the two independent samples were not distributed normally (From ``\emph{Shapiro-Wilk Normality Test}''\footnote{http://sdittami.altervista.org/shapirotest/ShapiroTest.html}). Also, Figure \ref{figure:usagedailysessions} shows trends on total daily sessions in between logbook and gamification conditions. This finding shows that there is a higher likelihood of a gamified system to be used more frequent compared to a logbook system.
\begin{table}[h!]

   		 		    Daily gamification sessions&41&49.28& 1701.5&&&\\
\hline
	\end{tabular}
  \end{center}
\end{table}
The pairwise usage comparison on number sessions between users on  two experimental conditions which excluded four pairs showed that the Log mean of number of sessions per day was significantly higher on gamification condition, M=0.459; SD=0.336, when compared to logbook condition, M=0.201 ;SD=0.196 with (t(9)= -2.6593 ; p= 0.0261 ; 95\% CI=  -0.477 to -0.039). The finding above suggests that there was an indication of a significant increase in frequency of daily usage when pairs where in gamification condition. The log mean is used in this case because the differences of logbook and gamification didn't have a normal distribution shape. Therefore, I performed transformation using a natural logarithm equation and after transformations on the original data, the differences of the new data on logbook and gamification had a normal distribution shape.

The utilization of different self-monitoring functionality on Figure \ref{figure:self_monitoring_usage}. showed that usage of some of the main self-monitoring features for steps and diet is lower in gamification compared to when in logbook condition. An explanation to this is that during  gamification condition users divided there attention between main logbook and virtual rewards. However, the trend in recording of diet/meals continued to remain the same between the two experimental conditions as the process of recording meals played an important role in earning some of the virtual rewards, therefore, intermediary users had to continue using that feature while in gamification condition. Figure \ref{figure:clicks_distr} shows the distribution of clicks among feedback features of the "Gamified Wellness App" and "The Logbook App".

    \rule{35em}{0.5pt}
  \caption{Total clicks on feedback features in the two experimental conditions : self-monitoring features versus rewards features.}
  \label{figure:clicks_distr}
\end{figure}
From Figure \ref{figure:clicks_distr}, we can see that gamification condition's clicks on feedback features are distributed between the main self-monitoring and virtual rewards features. The number of clicks on the main self-monitoring feedback features had decreased as users became interested to feedbacks provided by virtual rewards features more than the main self-monitoring features.

From Figure \ref{figure:usagedailysessions} above the trend shows the drop on Logbook condition as users who had been exposed to gamification condition before logbook condition became less interested with the "Logbook App" after being switched to it. The baseline data  can explain this usage information using descriptive trends since they were not statistically sufficient to explain the above usage. The drop in the total number of logbook sessions appears slightly the same in both younger and older intermediaries as shown on Figure \ref{figure:logbookbyage}.  But contrary to this is that younger intermediaries had slightly higher average on total number of sessions compared to the older ones while in gamification condition  as shown on Figure \ref{figure:gambyage}. Also on the average of total number sessions in both experimental conditions, the trend on average shows that younger intermediaries to have more sessions in overall as shown on Figure as more sessions were from gamification condition.  The term olerd and younger are defined by the age \textgreater= and \textless median age (15.5 years old) respectively.  Although the total number of sessions is relative to the number of days in which a pair of users had a particular experimental condition available to them, but younger and older intermediaries were evenly distributed to both experimental sequences (LG and GL groups). This means young and old intermediaries were both present in almost the same number in both experimental sequences hence their differences in number sessions which  is influenced by the number of days (27 days in phase 1 and 14 days in phase 2) are expected to cancel each other. The distribution by age group is presented on Table \ref{table:agregroupsall}.

For pairs who had usage problems on Table \ref{table:usageproblems},three out of four intermediary users were above the median age and one below age. A different trend that excludes the intermediary users that belong in these four pairs still appears to be similar to Figures \ref{figure:logbookbyage} and \ref{figure:gambyage}. For logbook condition, only intermediary users from Pairs A, B were removed as their participation as they terminated their early before switched to logbook condition. Pairs C and D started with Logbook and they participated through logbook conditions despite problems in Pair C since the beginning of experiments. Therefore, the new logbook trend only excluded pairs A, and B (Figures \ref{figure:logbookbyage_mod}). For the gamification condition, we removed pairs A,B,C, and D, as usage problems affected their ability to continue engaging with the app, therefore the new trend on average sessions is shown on Figure \ref{figure:gambyage_mod}.

\end{figure}
The same trends continue to hold as younger intermediaries appear to have higher average number sessions in gamification condition and lower average number of sessions in logbook condition. Koivisto and Hamari \cite{koivisto2014demographic} found that the usage of  a gamified system is highly affected by the novelty effect which is inversely proportional to the age of participants, meaning that highly usage due to the novelty effect may be reported in much younger participants.

The next trend is just looking at usage with respect to both ages of beneficiaries and intermediaries.  If we consider all beneficiary users from all fourteen pairs then the trend on average number of sessions is as shown on Figure \ref{figure:pairs_usage_sessions}. The median age for intermediaries was 15.5 years old while the median age for beneficiaries was 44 years old. Therefore an individual participant belongs to either younger or older group depending on whether ones age is below or above their respective median age. Pairs with a combination of a younger intermediary, and younger beneficiary appears to have more sessions in average. Most of these sessions were contributed by gamification.

  \label{figure:pairs_usage_sessions}
\end{figure}
On the next sub sections, user experiences of both intermediaries and beneficiaries are reported.
\subsection{Intermediaries' User Experience}
Most of the time, beneficiaries' usage of the app was facilitated by intermediaries in proximate enabling and proximate translation. These types of intermediated interactions have been discussed in the work by Sambasivan et al.\cite{sambasivan2010}. Baseline data indicated that interest of intermediary participants in using cellphones was higher than that beneficiary participants. For instance, in overall IMI scores to use cellphone, intermediaries (M=5.76, S.D= 0.41, N=14) scored  significantly higher than beneficiary participants (M=5.06, S.D= 0.71, N=13) with (t(25)= 3.1764, p=0.0039, 95\% CI = 0.2472 to 1.1589).

In user experience of intermediaries, the first finding is on how baseline intrinsic motivation and  demographic information such as age of intermediary users influenced user experience. From Figure \ref{figure:bothexpebyage} above, young intermediaries (age\textless median=15.5 years) appeared to had more number of sessions per day on average, but contrary to this trend was that, at baseline the average perceived enjoyment on helping with cellphone related tasks was higher in intermediaries with age\textgreater=median compared to intermediaries with age\textless median for the 12 intermediary users as shown on Figure \ref{figure:PE_HELP_Age}. 
\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Figures/PE_HELP_Age.png}
    \rule{35em}{0.5pt}
  \caption{Intermediaries' average perceived enjoyment to help others with cellphone tasks versus age group.}
  \label{figure:PE_HELP_Age}
\end{figure}
The descriptive finding on perceived enjoyment to use the family wellness app by age at midline and endline for the 12 intermediary users (excluding users from pairs A and B since they terminated their usage too soon) showed that the averages are higher on the intermediaries with age \textless median for both midline and endline points (Figure \ref{figure:PE_Interm_App}). If we split the two age groups by, participants with different characteristics are evenly present to both groups as shown on Table \ref{table:agegroups}. Therefore, comparison of trends by age groups in not much influenced by other factors such the experimental sequence of which participants were assigned to or gender.

  \label{figure:PE_Interm_App}
\end{figure}

\begin{table}[h!]
  \begin{center}
    \caption{Age groups of intermediary participants}
    \label{table:agegroups}
	\begin{tabular}{|c|L{3.2cm}|L{1cm}|L{2cm}|L{2cm}|L{1.6cm}|L{1.3cm}|}

         &\textbf{Age Groups}&\textbf{Total users}&\textbf{No. of GL sequence}&\textbf{No. of LG sequence}&\textbf{No. of Females}&\textbf{No. of Males}\\

         1&Age \textless 15.5 years&6&3&3&2&4\\

         2&Age \textgreater=15.5 years&6&2&4&4&2\\  
\hline
	\end{tabular}
  \end{center}
\end{table}

The trend on average perceived enjoyment in both logbook and gamified conditions appeared to be slightly higher in younger intermediaries compared to older intermediaries as shown on Figure \ref{figure:PE_Interm_App_exp_seq}. 
\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Figures/PE_Interm_App_exp_seq.png}

  \caption{Intermediaries' average perceived enjoyment in using the app versus age group (Logbook and Gamification).}
  \label{figure:PE_Interm_App_exp_seq}
\end{figure}

Figures \ref{figure:PE_Interm_App} and \ref{figure:PE_Interm_App_exp_seq}  suggest that the task of helping was more interesting to younger intermediaries due to the existence of the aforementioned motivational affordances.

There several factors that influence intermediaries to use the app and these are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{\textbf{The phone effect}}: The phenomenon of sharing phones was important in nurturing the relationship between intermediaries and beneficiaries. Parents were lending their phones to their kids to access social media sites and games. Having access to a phone while providing help to beneficiary participants can be viewed as one of the motivating factors to intermediary participants who didn't have smart-phones or data bundles in their smart-phones. Some intermediary participants had installed games, other apps on those phones.

\userquote{\textbf{Siyamthanda}, a female intermediary from Langa, 12 yrs old} {``I had freedom [in using the app] because sometimes she left the phone with me and I was able to play games''}

\userquote{\textbf{Aziza}, a female beneficiary from Athlone, 35 yrs old} {``We would fight over it[the app]. Because he always wants to be on the phone. Always always.''}

\userquote{\textbf{Likhaya}, a male intermediary from Langa, 16 yrs old} {``I didn't feel burdened. You know I also play games on the phone. [Implying he also played games with the phone during logbook condition therefore he didn't feel burdened to help his mother]''}

In the context of ICTD, non-prescribed use of devices or other technologies allocated for an intervention is considered to be an aspect of play which is a capability as it fosters motivation to participate in an intervention \citep{ferrplay2015}. Therefore, motivation introduced as the result of sharing phones can be viewed as part of motivational affordances to encourage ongoing use of a system through young intermediaries within family settings.

\item{\textbf{Gamification comparison}}: The ``Gamified App'' was designed in such a way that a pair will earn rewards based on usage and the average number of steps walked by a beneficiary participant who is a member of the pair. The purpose of rewards was to foster users' intrinsic experiences such as competitiveness and a sense of autonomy which are predictors of intrinsic motivation. Rewards depended on four parameters and these were the number of steps walked by a beneficiary user, the number of days the app has been used by an intermediary to either to record meals or to view feedback on meals, points, steps, gardens, etc. 

Comparison on virtual rewards among intermediaries motivated intermediaries to check the app more often compared to when they were in logbook condition as highlighted on the aforementioned usage findings (sub section \ref{usageoutcome}). Intermediaries were competing which other on the leader board and they talked about their points whenever they meet face to face.

\userquote{\textbf{Jenner}, a female beneficiary from Athlone, 45 yrs old} {``He [Leon (her 15 years old son) ] likes this exercise (using the app) because among him and his friends, they would have that competition like `I got more points than you' and that motivated him to get interested with the app''} 

The competition also led intermediaries to work closer with their beneficiaries.

\userquote{\textbf{Kelvin}, a male intermediary from Athlone, 15 yrs old} {``When I see other people trying to come above me [on the leader board]. I hand over the phone to my mom so she can walk more steps.''} 

\userquote{\textbf{Celine}, a female intermediary from Athlone, 16 yrs old} {``I told my mom that me my self I want our team to have the highest points. Yes she said she is going to do that.''} 

\userquote{\textbf{Sophia}, a female intermediary from Athlone, 17 yrs old} {``Sometimes that person may be first so I tell my mom that we must also be at the first place.[She looks at the  leader board and she sees so and so is at first place there she talks to her mother that they should also aim for the first position] ''} 

\userquote{\textbf{Jenner}, a female beneficiary from Athlone, 45 yrs old} {``When he [Leon] looked through it [The app] and sees their points, he would say `Mom, we need to do something here, because look at their points and our points'. So it was quite interesting.''} 

In one scenario a beneficiary described how serious her son was about the competition and the son was always reminding her to carry the pedometer whenever she wants to go out as shown on the following excerpt.

\userquote{\textbf{Jenner}, a female beneficiary from Athlone, 45 yrs old} {``Sometimes may be I forget to take the phone when I go walking and he would ask me `did you take the phone with you?' Ooh Gosh I forgot.  Because when I walk to park town to exercise and sometimes  I am in such a hurry I forget the phone, he will be crossed with me. ''} 

There was a scenario of one pair of whereby not only the beneficiary was using the pedometer, an intermediary was also taking turns to use the pedometer, therefore they were collaborating in accumulating steps. Both an intermediary user and a beneficiary user had discussions of whether the person whose turn it was had walk enough steps. They did this to accumulate more steps than other pairs. In addition to comparison other intermediary users came to the app to the gamified app to connect to other users.

\userquote{\textbf{Celine}, an intermediary} {``I ask her how far did you walk?  She would say she walked very far. She tells me that I must have the phone to walk more steps. She would say `I got more more walking than you' [They were collaborating with her mother in accumulating steps]. She sometimes writes the steps on the page and she tells me yesterday I day I had more points than you [points referring to steps ]''} 

Rewards were specific for gamification condition by they appeared to also affected pairs that had started with logbook conditions as some intermediary users were pushing their beneficiaries to do more by expecting to get rewards once they are switched to gamification condition.

\userquote{\textbf{Kefiloe}, a female beneficiary from Athlone, 26 years old} {``I think we talk more than before the family wellness app. Before the family wellness app, after work it was just ``Hi'' and then I go to my room but now. But now she would come to my room  and say let me see your phone,  what did you eat today,  and write everything down on the phone. So we are more closer than before because of this. Most of the time she used to say that `we must win this'''} 

\item{\textbf{Requests from beneficiary users}}: There were times where intermediary users engaged with the app only upon receiving requests from beneficiaries. In both absence and presence of gamification, intermediaries had to fulfil requests from beneficiaries.  But during logbook condition, intermediaries appeared to be less enthusiastic in handling those requests. Some beneficiaries complained that there were several incidences of where intermediaries were refusing to fulfil these requests and it happened more often during logbook condition. It was observed that in most of these cases, intermediary participants' autonomy was violated as requests came at times where intermediary participants were either studying for exams or doing something else and they felt it was not the right time to fulfil those requests. This made some of the intermediary participants to feel that their parents were nagging them. For instance, \textbf{Lunga}, a male intermediary participant from Langa, aged 17 years, felt annoyed when his mother insisted they should enter the family wellness app while he was busy using social media through the intervention's phone. This happened during logbook condition. Also a similar situation happened to \textbf{Jennifer}, female intermediary participants from Athlone, aged 18 years who also felt irritated by her mother's constant requests during logbook condition. In addition she felt the app was not that exciting as she said ``\emph{The app was okay first but it started to get boring. You don't want to go into it any more. I think there will be some excitement now if the game comes in. When do we get the game?}''. She was curious to know when they will be switched to gamification because she thought the logbook condition was boring. 
\end{enumerate} 

Interest of intermediaries or pairs in general varied as some exhibited interests on interacting with others through the app while others where focused on achievements (i.e. dominating others in competitions). Gamification appeared to be the most dominant factor that influenced usage as we have already seen that the frequency of usage showed a higher value in gamification when compared to logbook. 

\userquote{\textbf{Aziza}} {``We [with Kelvin] were not talking to others because all we wanted was to win. We didn't want them to know but they could see from the app''}
 
Only two intermediaries had tried to interact with others using social features of the app or comment on rewards from their peers. These are some of the comments that were shared by these participants.

\userquote{\textbf{Simon}, a male intermediary from Athlone, 15 yrs old} {``Fish are increasing neh.[He commented this on a fish tank owned by Kelvin and his mother]''} 

\userquote{\textbf{Siyamthanda}, a female } {``Wow it shows that you are working hard  Clara\#2.[She congratulated a female intermediary called Clara for being on the second position on Fish tanks.]''} 

However, not all intermediaries had a positive user experience on utilizing gamification, that is why the average perceived enjoyment appears to be lower for both age groups while in gamification condition compared to the logbook condition (Figure \ref{figure:PE_Interm_App_exp_seq}).

Leader-board can demotivate those users that are at the bottom but it can foster aspects of relatedness for all users\citep{sailer2013:psychological}. In this case there were users who never made any advancement in badges hence they appeared at the bottom of the leader board. Some participants it was due to technical problems as reported on Table \ref{table:usageproblems}. But there few exceptions of which two users had no technical problems but never had any advancement in badges despite their efforts in using the gamified system more than the logbook condition as shown on Figure \ref{figure:badge_failure_2}. One user was from the `LG' group (Keller), while the other one was from the `GL' group (Leon).  Their beneficiary participants were not walking enough steps despite the fact that these two intermediaries had put  more efforts in using the app during gamification condition than in logbook condition.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{Figures/badgesfailures2.png}
    \rule{35em}{0.5pt}
  \caption{Logbook Vs Gamification for two users that had no technical problems but never had any badge advancement.}
  \label{figure:badge_failure_2}
\end{figure}
Badges were earned in combination of both the app usage and average number of steps walked by a beneficiary user. One beneficiary who was working with one of these intermediary users also reported in interviews that there was always a contention with her intermediary when this beneficiary wanted to see what was going in the app as the intermediary was not voluntarily willing to help some of the time. It is hypothesized that this could be one of the factors that played a role in demotivating some participants during gamification condition. There were also cases of  where intermediaries doubted the credibility of the system because their peers appeared to be more engaged with the app, but were at lower positions on the leader board. 

\userquote{\textbf{Akhona}, a female intermediary from Langa, 16 yrs old} {``It [The experience in using the app] was the same as last time (during gamification) except for the game part. I was actually above some of the others. That was weird. Because they were more interested in the app than me.''} 

On the aforementioned excerpt, \emph{Akhona} was referring to the two intermediaries from pairs C , and D that had usage problem (Table \ref{table:usageproblems}) as these two users used the app more in logbook condition, therefore, Akhona's anticipation was that they would be more competent than her but surprisingly she was ahead of them.  Therefore, even in perceived competence Akhona reported lower score in gamification compared to logbook despite using gamification for 7 out of 14 days and logbook for only 4 out of 27 days.

Therefore, in comparing the support for the three basic psychological needs, pairs that never had any advancement in badges were not considered. An assumption was that a negative experience was the result of failure of the gamification design to match challenges with abilities. i.e. efforts of beneficiaries differed hence challenges should have matched with individual abilities of beneficiaries within pairs. When challenges are too difficult as they don't match users' skills, end users can become demotivated \citep{zhang2008motivational}. In addition, some of those that had technical problems, their problems were so severe to the extent that they were unable to participate fairly in gamification condition. A total of five intermediary users never had any advancement in badges, therefore, they were excluded in the analysis of motivation of which three are from those that had technical problems (Pairs A, C and D on Table) and two, they had dome more efforts in using the gamified system but there less steps detected from their beneficiaries. As result only nine intermediary users were considered in the main sub scales of intrinsic motivation (autonomy, competence, and enjoyment).    
  
The findings (Table \ref{table:imiwellnessinterm}) indicate that perceived competence of intermediaries in using the ``Family Wellness App'' was significantly higher in the gamified condition than in the logbook condition in the ten intermediaries that were analysed. Perceived autonomy, perceived enjoyment, and perceived relatedness were all not different between gamification condition and logbook condition. For perceived enjoyment and autonomy, there are cases were the self-monitoring task was interesting enough on itself or when combined with informal comparison of steps among intermediary users. Therefore, there some intermediaries who felt more enjoyment while they were in logbook condition, which is also the same case for perceived autonomy. For perceived relatedness, the app brought users together regardless of an experimental condition especially the ones that already knew each other before. Therefore increase in relatedness happened in both versions of the prototype.

\subsection{User Experience of Beneficiaries}
As most beneficiaries only interfaced with the app through intermediary users, beneficiaries' user experience relied on cooperation they got from intermediaries. There cases were beneficiaries had a negative experience as result of intermediaries refusing to assist upon being given requests. This happened in cases of where intermediary users didn't feel like helping because of other tasks. An overall motivation show that most beneficiaries were excited about engaging with their personal information. In addition to that, from Figure \ref{figure:pairs_usage_sessions}, a combination of younger intermediary and beneficiary users had more sessions in average and this is because gamification influenced younger intermediary users to use the app, while it also influenced younger beneficiaries to pass their requests to their respective intermediaries more often. For instance in interviewing one pair that consisted of a younger intermediary and beneficiary users, this pair had highest number of sessions in gamification. In the course of using the app they both exhibited playfulness behaviours in engaging with gamification of whereby they discussed strategies about beating other teams. So every time a beneficiary user from this pair would request her intermediary to open the app so that she can see if they are ahead of other teams.

Older intermediaries were not so much into gamification. What pushed them to use the app was more of both requests from their beneficiaries and their sense being more accountable to help. Therefore older intermediaries may have more empathy of why they are helping compared to younger intermediaries. So in this scenario, older intermediaries' usage may depend mostly on motivation of beneficiaries to request help while for young intermediaries, gamification may be a driving factor but beneficiaries need to be motivated too in order for intermediaries to be enthusiastic to share information with them.

In the next sub-section, the IMIs in self-monitoring of diet and activity are reported. Four pairs with usage problems (Table \ref{table:usageproblems}) were excluded.
\subsubsection{IMI in Self-Monitoring of Diet}
The results on self-monitoring of diet (baseline, midline, and endline) are shown on Table  \ref{table:imidietbenf}. The Mauchly’s test indicated that the assumption of sphericity was not violated with  $\chi{}$\SP{2}(2)=3.76, p=0.152. The results (N=10) on  ``Self-monitoring of Diet'' shown on Table \ref{table:imidietbenf} were from ``Sphericity Assumed'' output. ANOVA showed that there was a significant difference of average IMI scores on self-monitoring of diet measured at baseline, midline and endline.

\hline	\end{tabular}
  \end{center}
\end{table}
A finding from a pairwise comparisons (a paired student t-test) indicated that the IMI score at endline was significantly higher than at baseline (Table \ref{table:imipairwisediet}). There was no significant difference on baseline versus midline and midline versus endline (Tables \ref{table:imipairwisediet1}, and \ref{table:imipairwisediet2}). Motivation to self-monitor diet appeared to increase with time as shown on Figure \ref{figure:imi_diet}. The interpretation of the above findings are that the wellness app appeared to had a significant effect of time on motivation of beneficiaries to self-monitor their diet.

The aforementioned ANOVA finding on comparison among baseline, midline, and endline doesn't discern between different experimental conditions of which pairs of users were exposed to. The ANOVA finding (N=10)(Table  \ref{table:imidietbenf2}) on the comparison of IMI scores to self-monitor diet, among baseline, logbook, and gamification conditions showed that there was no significant difference of average IMI scores on self-monitoring of diet measured during baseline, logbook and gamification conditions. This finding is from the ``Sphericity Assumed'' output of the ANOVA test since the Mauchly’s test indicated that the assumption of sphericity was not violated with  $\chi{}$\SP{2}(2)=2.19, p=0.335. The trend on averages shows both logbook and gamification to be slightly higher than baseline as shown on Figure \ref{figure:imi_diet2}. The conclusion from this finding is that both versions of the prototype have shown an indication of increasing motivation of beneficiaries to self-monitor diet.

\end{figure}
\subsubsection{IMI in Self-Monitoring of Activity}
The results (N=9) on self-monitoring of activity are shown on Table  \ref{table:imiactivitybenf}. The results are based on a sample of nine beneficiary users as one participant didn't complete this part of the questionnaire at baseline.  The Mauchly’s test indicated that the assumption of sphericity was violated with  $\chi{}$\SP{2}(2)=8.248, p=0.016. The value $\epsilon$ on Greenhouse Geisser was ``\textless 0.75'', therefore, the results on  ``Self-monitoring of Diet'' shown on Table \ref{table:imiactivitybenf} were selected from ``Greenhouse-Geisser'' output. ANOVA showed that there was no significant difference of average IMI scores on self-monitoring of activity measured at baseline, midline and endline. The trend of means appears to increase from baseline to endline as shown on Figure \ref{figure:imi_activity}.

There are several factors that could have contributed to results not being significant among baseline, midline,endline points,. The first hypothesized reason is tracking of physical activity appeared to be easy in majority of the participants even without tracking devices as people can estimate the distance they walk daily and they consider this as tracking even though they might have means to record this information, hence their motivation was high at baseline unlike diet self-monitoring which they consider it to be cumbersome due to external barriers such as health food being expensive, therefore at baseline participants felt more motivated to track their activity. The second hypothesized reason is that the sample size was small hence there was a smaller power in detecting significant difference. But we have seen that the trend in motivation increases with time.

\end{figure}
The finding from an analysis (N=9) that examined if there is a difference among baseline,logbook, and gamification in self-monitoring of activity, showed that there was no significant difference of average IMI scores on self-monitoring of activity measured at baseline, logbook and gamification (Table {table:imiactivity2benf}). The Mauchly’s test indicated that the assumption of sphericity was violated with  $\chi{}$\SP{2}(2)=6.788, p =0.034. The value of $\epsilon$ on Greenhouse Geisser was ``\textless 0.75'', therefore, these results on  ``Self-monitoring of Activity'' were selected from ``Greenhouse-Geisser'' output of oen way with repeated measures ANOVA test. The trend in motivation increases in both logbook and gamification compared to baseline as shown on Figure \ref{figure:imi_activity2}
