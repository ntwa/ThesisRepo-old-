The deployment study with twenty five newly diagnosed individuals with diabetes demonstrated that MAHI significantly contributed to individuals' achievement of their diabetes management goals (changing diet). More importantly, MAHI inspired individuals to adopt Internal Locus of Control, which often leads to persistent engagement in self-care and positive health outcomes.},

abstract = {Summary form only given. Increasing prevalence of lifestyle-related health risks and chronic diseases, coupled with limited resources in the healthcare system, calls for citizen-centric health promotion and disease prevention measures as well as new care models for management of chronic diseases. As a future scenario emphasis of the health care should gradually shift from treating and managing of diseases to their prevention and early interventions. The risk of chronic diseases begins to rise and physical capacity begins to decline after the age of 30. Therefore, working-age citizens are an important target group for health promotion and early interventions. Personal Health Systems (PHS) may be used for supporting psychological therapies, self-management of chronic diseases, and behavioral change. Especially Web-based programs have been successfully utilized for facilitating self-monitoring, distribution of information, and communications between clients and healthcare professionals. More recently, the focus has started to turn towards mobile devices and health monitoring tools. By combing different technologies into a comprehensive toolbox of methods for health management, providing the citizen freedom to choose which of them to use, and offering him a specifically designed technology supported intervention program, has proved as a successful strategy. In this presentation, some of these results are reviewed.},

The behavioral-science paradigm seeks to develop and verify theories that explain or predict human or organizational behavior. The design-science paradigm seeks to extend the boundaries of human and organizational capabilities by creating new and innovative artifacts. Both paradigms are foundational to the IS discipline, positioned as it is at the confluence of people, organizations, and technology. Our objective is to describe the performance of design-science research in Information Systems via a concise conceptual framework and clear guidelines for understanding, executing, and evaluating the research. In the design-science paradigm, knowledge and understanding of a problem domain and its solution are achieved in the building and application of the designed artifact. Three recent exemplars in the research literature are used to demonstrate the application of these guidelines. We conclude with an analysis of the challenges of performing high-quality design-science research in the context of the broader IS community.},

We present the design, implementation and evaluation of BeWell, an automated wellbeing app for the Android smartphones and demonstrate its feasibility in monitoring multi-dimensional wellbeing.

@book{Mattila2010,
abstract = {The increasing prevalence of lifestyle-related health risks coupled with the lack of resources in preventative healthcare calls for novel and cost-efficient methods for supporting citizens in their independent health and well-being management. Behaviour modification is an efficient way of preventing chronic diseases and other lifestyle-related health problems, provided that the healthy behaviours are sustained over the long term. The challenge is to develop efficient methods that support citizens in their health management and empower them to take more responsibility for their health. Psychological methods, such as those based on cognitive-behavioural therapies, provide an understanding of behaviour change as well as efficient methods for supporting it. However, providing preventative face-to-face therapies for health promotion is not economically feasible and does not necessarily offer the long-term support required to establish permanent healthy behaviours. Lately, information and communication technologies have been harnessed for use in health promotion programs. Mobile phones provide a particularly promising platform for health management applications due to their central role in people's lives as well as their technical capabilities. This thesis presents a mobile phone application for supporting the self-management of health and well-being, targeting working-age citizens. The Wellness Diary (WD) is based on a core method in cognitive-behavioural self-management, self-monitoring. The main aim was to enable the long-term self-management of well-being with the help of a mobile terminal. WD has been evaluated in several studies with different user groups and in different research settings. Three of the evaluations are presented in this thesis. Based on the results, most users found WD to be easy to use and useful. Furthermore, a significant number of users used WD regularly over several months, which shows that WD is capable of enabling long-term selfmonitoring. Copyright VTT 2010.},

Many of the diseases and health risks could be prevented or alleviated by making changes toward healthier lifestyles. We have developed the Wellness Diary (WD), a concept for personal and mobile wellness management based on Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT). Two implementations of the concept were made for the Symbian Series 60 (S60) mobile phone platform, and their usability, usage, and acceptance were studied in two 3-month user studies. Study I was related to weight management and study II to general wellness management. In both the studies, the concept and its implementations were well accepted and considered as easy to use and useful in wellness management. The usage rate of the WD was high and sustained at a high level throughout the study. The average number of entries made per day was 5.32 (SD = 2.59, range = 0-14) in study I, and 5.48 (SD = 2.60, range = 0-17) in study II. The results indicate that the WD is well suited for supporting CBT-based wellness management.},

	Abstract = {We have developed an enhanced Littrow configuration extended cavity diode laser (ECDL) that can be tuned without changing the direction of the output beam. The output of a conventional Littrow ECDL is reflected from a plane mirror fixed parallel to the tuning diffraction grating. Using a free-space Michelson wavemeter to measure the laser wavelength, we can tune the laser over a range greater than 10 nm without any alteration of alignment.},

	Abstract = {Operating a laser diode in an extended cavity which provides frequency-selective feedback is a very effective method of reducing the laser's linewidth and improving its tunability. We have developed an extremely simple laser of this type, built from inexpensive commercial components with only a few minor modifications. A 780~nm laser built to this design has an output power of 80~mW, a linewidth of 350~kHz, and it has been continuously locked to a Doppler-free rubidium transition for several days.},
