\begin{abstract} 
The pandemic of lifestyle-related chronic diseases has led to an advent of personal health informatics, with the goal of persuading individuals to adopt healthful lifestyles. Such systems implement various motivational affordances to promote ongoing use. Design of such systems focuses in engaging only the beneficiary of information derived from those systems. In this study we explored how one can use gamification to motivate ongoing usage of such systems in the context of intermediated technology use. We studied the effect of gamification in motivating young family members in assisting adults who might be less conversant or intimidated with such a technology. We compared two designs of a mobile wellness application of which one prototype was gamified and the other one was not gamified. Our findings suggest that virtual rewards can enhance usage of such systems through intermediary users. We highlight some of the design implications in order to foster perceived enjoyment in using such a system.

\section{Introduction} 
Lifestyle-related diseases are now attracting many players seeking to design low cost and tailored information and communications technology (ICT)- based systems for supporting lifestyle change and disease management\cite{arsand:mobile} with most recent development focusing in persuasive technlogies. A systematic review of 95 studies on persuasive technologies found out that persuasive systems have the capability to persuade because their design include implementation of persuasion stimuli \cite{hamari2014persuasive}.\newline
Persuasive systems include personal informatics which can be used for persuasion of health behaviours. Personal informatics systems are interactive applications that support users to become self-aware of patterns in the behaviours, by providing means to collect personal history, as well as tools for its review or analysis \cite{li2011:personal,li2012:personal}. Persuasion stimuli in a personal informatics rely on their ability to support reflective learning/self-reflection \cite{li2011:understanding}. Reflective learning entails reviewing of collected personal data to learn about oneself and the user always alternates between two phases known as discovery of a behaviour pattern and maintenance of a better behaviour\cite{li2011:understanding}. These phases are usually supported through feedback mechanisms such as bar charts or other affective mechanisms such as gardens that represent steps walked (i.e Ubifit\cite{klasnja2009:using}) or Fish growing or shrinking depending to an increase or decrease in the number of steps walked (i.e Fish'nSteps \cite{lin2006:fish}). The aforementioned techniques can further be supplemented with social comparison\cite{Oinas-kukkonen:psd} or competitions with others \cite{comber2013:designing} in some systems. Feature that support competitions have become popular in personal health informatics~\cite{hamari2014persuasive} and this is encouraged by borrowing of game design elements into non-game contexts, referred to as ``\emph{Gamification}'' ~\cite{deterding2011game}. \newline
Despite the popularity of gamification its capability to invoke intrinsic experiences may be constrained to specific demographics. For instance, one study found out that perceived interest decreases with age and this implies that such a gamified system might be more effective with younger populations\cite{v2014motivational}. In order to leverage the power of gamification with older alduts, we propose replication of one of the prevalent mode of access to technology referred to as intermediated technology use\cite{sambasivan2010}. Instead of just involving an adult beneficiary user in interacting with a personal informatics for health, we bring young family members to become part of the interaction and apply gamification to foster ongoing use since gamification works well with young people.\newline
In this study we report on the outcome of using gamification and how different it is in comparison to involving intermediaries without gamification. We also propose approaches that can enhance the impact of gamification in the context of personal health informatics used through intermediary users.
\section{Related Work} 
Zhang et al.\cite{zhang2008:motivational} suggested a list of motivational affordances that could be implemented in a system in order to foster its usage such as: (1) the system should afford self-identity and autonomy;(2) the system should support provision of challenges/competitions; (3)the system should allow users to relate to each other; etc. The aforementioned motivational affordances must be fulfilled in order to support the three basic psychological needs that are suggested by self-determination theory (SDT) and these are: (1) the need for autonomy; (2)the need for challenges/competitions that are developmentally appropriate;  (3) the need to belong to a group \cite{deci1985:intrinsic}. Individuals engage in activities to satisfy the aforementioned psychological needs \cite{deterding2011:situated}. The support for the three needs is important for a person to feel intrinsically motivated to perform a certain task.\newline     
Personal health informatics have been designed with specific motivational affordances to facilitate the ability of user to understand themselves through their collected personal data and continue to be motivated to engage with their collected personal data with the goal of changing their lifestyles or behaviours. For instance a personal informatics with just a self-monitoring feature can satisfy the need for challenges as users set goal and challenge themselves to attain that goal. Literature in public health also recognizes goal setting as an important part towards change in health behaviours~\cite{strecher1995goal}. Other motivation affordances that support competitions and relatedness with others can be implemented to support the process of self-monitoring. \newline
The motivation pull behind video games is explained by the self-determination theory \cite{ryan2006:motivationalpull}. Gamification is an idyllic avenue for engaging users with personal informatics or persuasive technology targeting health behaviour change because of its ability to trigger intrinsic experiences. Gamification usually borrows game design mechanics such as points, leader-boards, badges, etc hence it can support the three aforementioned psychological needs. However, perceived interest/enjoyment in gamification diminishes with age \cite{v2014motivational}. But the phenomenon of young people providing support to adults on technological related problems is quite prevalent in both HCI and ICTD literature. Studies have explored factors influencing help-seeking and giving behaviours and have pointed out factors such group orientations towards tasks unfamiliarity with technology, social rapport,reciprocal benefits, the sense of being accountable and many others to play a significant role in mediating help-seeking and help giving behaviors in various contexts.\cite{sambasivan2010,poole:chh,kiesler:twi,parikh2006}.However the aforementioned literature in intermediated technology use is limited to general use technology and it has not focus on specialized technology such as personal health informatics which has received a lot of attention within HCI community. Therefore it is unknown of how one could utilize motivational affordances to support ongoing use a personal health informatics through intermediary users.\newline
We can extend intermediated technology use and couple it with gamification in utilization of personal health informatics since we already know that gamification is promising in young populations. The use of gamification has been limited to tasks such as learning/teaching, image annotation tasks etc. and not to intermediated information tasks. The intermediated information task is different from other tasks as there may be two users collaborating to engage with a user interface with the goal of one user assisting another user with his/her information needs. For the case of personal informatics, motivational affordances need to motivate the two users to work together in engaging with the system.\newline  
Therefore our main research question attempts to understand the effectiveness of gamification in facilitating usage through intermediary users.
